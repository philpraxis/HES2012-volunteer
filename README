So you want to be a volunteer for HES2012:

send a mail to: hes-orga <hes-orga@lists.hackitoergosum.org>
including: 
* your github account name
* the tasks you're familiar with.

We request volunteer to help before and during the conference.
It's not heavy work but requires sometime serious work to meet deadline.
We use Github to manage tasks.
We'll attribute you some tasks there, activate "receive mail" for your github account to know about new tasks.
Make sure you give us feedback in comments of tasks.
Contact hes-orga in case of troubles.

The volunteer manager is TaD. 
TaD and Phil will add you to Github task tracker.

Github task tracker is located at:
