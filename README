So you want to be a volunteer for HES2012:

send a mail to: hes-orga <hes-orga@lists.hackitoergosum.org>
including: 
* your github account name
* the tasks you're familiar with.

We request volunteer to help before and during the conference.
It's not heavy work but requires sometime serious work to meet deadline.
We use Github to manage tasks.
